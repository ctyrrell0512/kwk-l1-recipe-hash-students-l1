#1. Create a hash called `perfect_10_recipe` that has the following data:
# perfect_10_recipe= {}

# perfect_10_recipe[:almond_flour] = "2 cups"
# perfect_10_recipe[:gluten_freewhole_oats] = "1 cup"
# perfect_10_recipe[:kosher_salt] = "1/2 tea spoon"
# perfect_10_recipe[:baking_powder]  = "1/2 tea spoon"
# perfect_10_recipe[:baking_soda] = "1/4 tea spoon"
# perfect_10_recipe[:Xanthan_Gum] = "1/2 tea spoon"
# perfect_10_recipe[:slivered_almonds_lightly_toasted] = "1/4 cup"
# perfect_10_recipe[:mini_dark_chocolate_chips] = "3/4 cup"
# perfect_10_recipe[:olive_oil] = "1/2 cup"
# perfect_10_recipe[:agave] = "1/4 cup"
# All of the ingredients should be symbols and the amounts should be strings. Remember that symbols start with a colon and be sure to sub underscores for spaces.
# puts perfect_10_recipe

perfect_10_recipe = {:almond_flour=>"2 cups", :gluten_freewhole_oats=>"1 cup", :kosher_salt=>"1/2 tea spoon", :baking_powder=>"1/2 tea spoon", :baking_soda=>"1/4 tea spoon", :Xanthan_Gum=>"1/2 tea spoon", :slivered_almonds_lightly_toasted=>"1/4 cup", :mini_dark_chocolate_chips=>   "3/4 cup", :olive_oil=>"1/2 cup", :agave=>"1/4 cup"}

puts perfect_10_recipe




#2. Write a method that simply returns (not puts) your perfect_10 hash
def recipe_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
  return perfect_10_recipe
end

 puts recipe_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)



#2: Write code that returns the amount of chocolate chips from perfect_10 ingredients that is needed in the recipe.
def amount_of_chocolate_chips(perfect_10_recipe)
  return perfect_10_recipe.values[7]
end

amount_of_chocolate_chips(perfect_10_recipe)


#3: Use `puts` to print out every ingredient and amount in the hash by iterating through the collection. You'll want to use the `each` method.
def ingredients_and_amounts(perfect_10_recipe)
  perfect_10_recipe.each do |ingredient, amount|
    puts "#{ingredient} #{amount}"
  end
end



#4: Now use `puts` to print out just the ingredients without the amounts. You'll want to use the `each_key` method.
def ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
  perfect_10_recipe.keys.each do |ingredient|
    puts "#{ingredient}"
  end
end




#5: Now use `puts` to print out just the amounts without the ingredients. You'll want to use the `each_value` method.
def amounts(perfect_10_recipe)
  perfect_10_recipe.values.each do |amount|
    puts "#{amount}"
  end
end

#6: Return the number of ingredients in the `perfect_10_recipe` hash.
def number_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
  perfect_10_recipe.size
end
